Relevant things that vary btwn runs:

==========
in starjob:

save_model_filename = '/home/lbouma/software/mesa/base/LOGS/M0.7_Z0.015_photospheretable.mod' !MASS! !INITIAL_Z!

! CHANGE SOLAR ABUNDANCES
      ! if `set_uniform_initial_composition` is true, then
      ! set hydrogen and helium mass fractions according to the following:
      ! If no h2 in current net, then this will be added to h1.
      ! If no he3 in current net, then this will be added to he4.
      ! use values from Table 4, protosolar of Asplund+ 2009
      initial_h1 = 0.723785524 !INITIAL_H1! 
      initial_h2 = 1.4476e-05 !INITIAL_H2!
      initial_he3 = 4.33592e-05 !INITIAL_HE3!
      initial_he4 = 0.2611566408 !INITIAL_HE4!
      !abundances for initial Z of _0.015_end


in controls:
      initial_mass = 0.7 !MASS! in Msun units


!OUTPUT OPTIONS:
      star_history_name = 'M0.7_Z0.015_history.data' !MASS! !INITIAL_Z!
      profiles_index_name = 'profiles_M0.7_Z0.015.index' !MASS! !INITIAL_Z!
      profile_data_prefix = 'profile_M0.7_Z0.015_' !MASS! !INITIAL_Z!

!!! Zbase? It's called in run_star_extras.f
-> reading the code (line 70 relevant file) it looks like it's computed as
1 - initial_h1_frac - initial_h2_frac - initial_he3_frac - initial_he4_frac.
So it's constant btwn runs.

==============================

PUT THIS ALL IN `run-tides`, where the inlists will be kept :)

Note: we should separate the coder tasks of creating the inlists and actually
running the jobs once the inlists have been defined.
(we initially did these simultaneously, but this kind of interactivity is
discouraged in order to protect against overwrites)

Ah, ALSO we'd like to index these things in a good way. For instance let's say
we want N*M grid, for N masses, and M metallicities.
We thus need that many indices. We could try diagonal, or just go over mass,
then metallicity (a flattening).

Make it M+1 metallicities, so that we always also run 0.015 -- the special
solar-calibrated case.

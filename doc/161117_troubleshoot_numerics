The summary image indicates that if we're willing to impose Mstar>=0.45Msun (or we
could fine-tune slightly lower), all the models will converge.

However this raises questions. MESA is supposed to "just work" for M<0.45Msun.
We should trouble-shoot before doing anything like just brushing the lowest
mass models under the rug; we see the "wiggle" from 0.45-0.55Msun!
Note that Y^2 isochrones stop at 0.4Msun [J. Hartman discussion], likely b/c of
some related numerical problems.
Potentially relevant physical factors (likely do not explain):
* Maybe the opacity tables change in a smart way that is more than just
  mass-dependant. (Go to low Mstar, become dominated by molecules). But perhaps
  not smart enough.
* Maybe the star becomes fully convective in a risky way. When trying to define 
  a convective/radiative boundary (in MESA) this becomes a problem.
* Lower mass -> should spin slower (perhaps isn't incorporated right)
* Mixing length parameter Î± should change (but we're saying it doesnt)


If not, then the next Qs for trouble-shooting are likely:
* Does Choi+ 2016 address this? (what is their minimum mass?)
* Are my luminosity vs age tracks for a single star (the messed up ones) the same 
  as the MIST ones? (Not sure if they publish them...). If not, why not?
* When do we see the divergence happening? Is it after age of universe?
  (log(age) of 10.3).
* Carefully read raw output logs for failed runs. What is happening at the
  relevant times?
* Cursory glimpse of the logs show "hydro_newton_step returned ierr". Read MESA
  source & mailing lists to see what exactly this means & whether this is known
  behavior.
* Longer shot: create a simple example, post it to MESA mailing list, see if
  the experts have an idea.

No, it's before. As early as log10(age)=9.2.

They claim to go:
 5< log(Age) [yr] < 10.3, 0.1 < M/Msun < 300, -2 < [Z/H] < 0.5.

So a comparably reasonable space for us to do should be:
 5 < log(Age) [yr] < 10.3, 0.3 < M/Msun < 1.3, -1 < [Z/H] < 0.5.

While we currently are doing:
 5.5 < log(Age) [yr] < x, 0.3 < M/Msun < 1.3, -1 < [Z/H] < 0.5.

The earliest _failure_ is at log(age)~=9.2, but with an obvious
numerically-induced spike as early as log(age)=8.7.
(So the cheap workaround of "just impose age of universe" constraint is no
good).

  In other words, are there similar wiggles at the low mass end of these track.eep 
  files? 

First, we don't expect them to be _exactly_ the same b/c we decided to do this
different thing with solar calibration.
HOWEVER it may be the case that we should instead aim to replicate the published 
(on their website) MIST models, even though they don't reproduce the sun. We are 
not exactly experts in stellar modelling. 
Getting the sun wrong is perhaps preferable to having non-understood numerical 
instabilities.

I made 4 useful plots:
  1. mist_sun_vs_time_near_sun_age.pdf
  2. mist_0.39Msun_props_vs_time.pdf
  3. mist_0.40Msun_props_vs_time.pdf
  4. mist_0.35Msun_props_vs_time.pdf

To make them, I downloaded [Fe/H]=0 evolutionary tracks from MIST at
http://waps.cfa.harvard.edu/MIST/model_grids.html.

The first is the reminder of how wrong we get the sun.
The second is R, L, Teff for their solar metallicity 0.39Msun star.
The third is R, L, Teff for their solar metallicity 0.40Msun star.
The fourth is R, L, Teff for their solar metallicity 0.35Msun star.

The latter two have "wiggles" for us. And the third doesn't converge.

W/ MIST data, 0.39Msun and 0.40Msun don't show any wiggles.
HOWEVER 0.35Msun __does__. So I'm not way off here! (or whatever numerical
instabilities we're dealing w/ are in MIST's models, with their different metal
mass fracs, as well).

Creating MIST_low_mass_props_vs_time.pdf, 0.34-0.36Msun has this.

[[[
There are mentions in MIST docs of "_INTERP" models (which did not converge due to
numerical stability issues). However it looks like these are only for high mass
stars. (So this, and the associated interpolation scheme, is irrelevant to our
issue).
]]]

==============================

* One reasonable new idea: maybe our TIMESTEP is killing us. Some of these
MIST models wiggle, but their MS timestep is so big that they might just "gloss
over" whatever numerical issues we're trying to resolve... **

> grid_6:

Answer is no. Timestep is not a big deal, and in fact smaller timestep may
actually be more helpful.
(Comparing grid_6 and grid_4)

** Read carefully thru Choi's input scripts:
https://github.com/jieunchoi/MIST_codes/blob/master/scripts/make_inlist_inputs.py

B/c she might be using different BCs than what I've been using!!

(Perhaps, just use / adapt hers for adroit?)

Important emails from the relevant weeks:
* Dave Williams
* Jieun Choi
* Dappen & Rhodes.

Two relevant things:
1) We want to reproduce the sun's moment of inertia. This requires knowing what
it is. Values listed on the web (e.g. by Dave Williams' goddard-hosted site)
are wrong, and any value in the literature is model dependent. You can compute
it based on a variety of œÅ(r) profiles. Values in the literature:
  * Integrating Schwarzschild 1958 standard solar model gives 6.2e53.
  * Ditto Christen-Dalsgaard 1996 gives 7.07990201e53, which is used in
    wrangle_output.py for comparison.
    Non-dimensionalized (dividing out by Choi+ mass*radius^2) gives 0.073573.
  Other papers include (research by David Williams in his email):
  * Gravitational potential energy of the Sun, Bursa, M, et al., 
    STUDIA GEOPHYSICA ET GEODAETICA   Volume: 40   Issue: 1 Published: 1996
    Which uses a 1981 model of Landolt-Bornstein and appears to come up with 
    I = 0.07897.
  * Iorio, Solar Physics, 1:47, July 2012 summarizes a bunch of angular
    momentum numbers and gives an average which corresponds to a moment of
    inertia of 0.0696, although they have values that go as high as 0.074, but
    as low as 0.059 (Robinson, 2000).  
  * Ballet and Bouvier, Astronomy and Astrophysics, 577, A98, 2015 quote a value 
    equivalent to 0.666 without attribution - I think it might just be a simple 
    model number.  And I
  * A detailed paper is Komm et al., Astrophysical J., 586, 650, 2003, which
   gives an angular momentum of 1.94 x 10**48 g cm**2 /s which translates to
   a moment of inertia of 0.0704.

We use the value from CD96 as our reference solar moment of inertia. Different
reliable-seeming sources in the literature vary by as much as 5% away from this.

2) We want to reproduce the sun's L, R, Teff at ~4.5Gyr (4.57, which is the
commonly assumed "age of the Sun", which I think (not sure) included PMS
contractions (see Bahcall+ 2006)).
The MIST input parameters as published, and also as given by Choi et al on the
MIST website, do not produce the sun when using protosolar abundances tuned to 
match modern-day abundances given by Asplund+ 2009. This is a "well-known" 
problem in the field.
Jieun Choi, in her emails, noted the inconsistencies, but apparently in their
work they opted to keep using the protosolar abundances required to match
Asplund's envelope abundances in order to... match the sound speed profile
better? Not incredibly sure.
REGARDLESS Table 2 of Choi+ (2016) gives special solar-calibrated values that DO
work when implemented with eqs (1)-(3) of the Choi+ (2016) paper.
This uses both a mixing length and special protosolar abundances that are tuned
to match the modern day sun's LRTeff, and it works (see Choi emails).

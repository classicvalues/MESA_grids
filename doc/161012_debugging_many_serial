TODO:
* look at output of 421710* and debug it.
* crank out final technical memo edits before FRIDAY (b/c ur on a bus that day). 
* remember that cute statistical idea we had for metal-rich stars in kepler
  needing to have more HJs? (was there more than that?)
* get to demolishing your NSF. money matters.
==============================

Looking at logs...:
* the naming doesn't work... all M?.?'s (all masses) have M1.2.
* ALSO it may take longer than you thought. it's not clear that even 1 job
  finished in 1hr.

* we KNOW that our main in run_mesa_serial is wrong (or at least,
  overcomplicated)

> running mesa_single (run_mesa, at M=1.1) to double-check time expectations.

Job hit time limit! (after TWO HOURS!)
At this point, it's at 8.7e9yr.

So right, my time estimate per star (30min) was a factor of ~5 off because I was
previously running it multithreaded over 5 cores.
Expect roughly ~30*5=150minutes, or 2.5hr per star.

> resubmitted M=1.1 as 421774.

==============================

* figure out many runs I/O (how do we make sure that the right "inlist_to_run"
  is being used when we're acting as if it's a dynamic document?

something's wrong. resubmitted for 3 HOURS didn't complete!!

trying for 3hr, 59minutes. running 0.7Msun.

Well, this run took from 16:14 to 16:48, and it was single core.

Perhaps there's a M_star specific problem?

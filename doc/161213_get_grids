It's "a ^{3}He-driven instability near the transition from fully
convective to radiative core during the MS."

See 161202_Choi_figA1.png (!!)

==========
X run 0.35-0.55Msun with tau_100 BCs, 0.02Msun gap rather than 
  photosphere_tables (based on the original MIST inlist).

  X  Fri 02 Dec 2016 05:45:12 PM EST
  begin run (fortunately 44 cores are instantly available. nice.)

  X look at results; update debug_summary

  M0.35_Z0.015 was "bad data", but the rest seem to have at least ran.
  (Looking at star_grid_425680_3.out, same hydro_newton_step error. However the
  interesting thing is that IMMEDIATELY upon switching from simple photosphere
  to tau_100_tables is when the failure happens (model 100). 
  Could it be that this switch is the "hard-bump" that we see in radius of the 
  merged R(t) plots?)

  Ok. The obvious good thing here is that many of the stars that previously
  wiggled now do not (at least in radius; there is a minor "stepping" in
  luminosity but these looks qualitatively like much less of an issue. Also, all
  of those converge).
  The only case of a star that does not converge is M0.35_Z0.015.

  I can do this w/ Kalo's widget!
  ... not quite. We want the x axis to be whatever we want. This requires
  modding Kalo's app. This will take longer than just writing it myself (for
  now..)

  HR_full_M0.35_Z0.0474341649025.pdf

  these indicate that it's almost certainly the same thing. The nail in the
  coffin should be star_grid_425680_4.out.

  We should see a mildly-bumpy X3He,center, near 0.01 (per 3rd panel of
  figA1_row5.png)

  Uh... looking at the log, He_cntr is oscillating around 0.298 (up and down,
  as expected, in the age range of 1e10 - 2e10 years)

X Read more about what the instability is from Choi+ 2016. 
  > A ^{3}He-induced instability during the transition from fully convective to
  > radiative core (during MS)

X do tau_100_tables BC, with the addition of "non-special" solar abundances.
  i.e. REPRODUCE Choi's results.
  (grids running as of Sat 03 Dec 2016 12:38:27 AM EST on adroit)
  > result: all models do converge. (w/ some wiggles)

X Run "even" numbers w/ solar (not Choi+) calibr. 
  (see if M0.35_Z0.015 is indeed a special case, or if it's a generic problem. 
  I.e. M0.34,M0.36,M0.38,...)
  > did mostly, but cancelled (b/c it's a waste of time. We have production
  > runs to do below).

X modify grid & file naming convention for low-mass stars (below 0.6Msun, following
  Choi+ 2016) to account for different BCs.
  also, move BC setting to "inlist_cluster" (via the scripts that make these)
  instead of the current scheme

X Implement production_grid_0:
  0.4-1.2Msun, 0.1Msun spaced
  Z from -1 to 0.5, 0.25 dex
  Below 0.6Msun, use tau_100_tables for BC
  Above 0.6Msun, use photosphere_tables for BC
  
  (n.b. this ignores the 0.35M_Z0.015 non-convergence when using solar
  fine-tuned protosolar abundances, b/c we don't need to go that far down in
  mass)

  X Running as of Tue 13 Dec 2016 11:11:47 AM EST
  done & it looks good.

TODO:

* See how Kalo's interpolation works

* Can still contact Jieun Choi to see if she has any further thoughts on this
  technical issue

* Longer shot: create a simple example, post it to MESA mailing list, see if
  any broader insight
